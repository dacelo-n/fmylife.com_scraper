## Fmylife.com post generator
This simple scraper is built using Scrapy for Python. Its goal is to scrap simple information such as the post title, post, up
and downvotes, and amount of comments. More or less can be added, such as time of post, author name, etc.

## Goal

The idea is to have a web scraper pull posts, train a model on the examples, and produce a post that will gain many votes and create a large thread of responses
based on the criteria discovered that leads to the most votes.
